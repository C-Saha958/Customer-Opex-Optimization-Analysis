# Customer Behavior Analysis: Optimizing Operational Expenditure (Opex)
## Summary: Driving Margin Restoration

This project analyzes customer shopping behavior to restructure marketing and pricing Operational Expenditure (Opex), resulting in immediate cost savings and strategic customer targeting.

The core finding is that blanket discounts are inefficient, eroding margin without increasing basket size. By focusing on quantifiable Opex control, this analysis delivers an immediate, actionable strategy to restore profitability.

# The Business Problem

The challenge was to answer: How can the company strategically restructure its Operational Expenditure (Opex) on marketing and promotions to maximize profit margins and increase Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)?

This directly addresses two key areas of inefficiency:

Promotional Opex: Costs associated with giving unnecessary pricing discounts.

Marketing Opex: Retention spending that is not focused on the most profitable customers.

## 1. Proof of Inefficient Promotional Opex (Pricing Strategy)

The analysis demonstrated that the discount strategy is acting as a cost center, not a revenue driver.

Metric                    Undiscounted AOV             Discounted AOV               Result

Average Order Value       $60.13                        $59.28                       AOV is higher without a discount.
(AOV)

Insight: The margin erosion of 1.42% confirms that budget allocated to promotional Opex is being wasted, as the discount is only cannibalizing margin on items customers were already willing to buy.

## 2. CLV Segmentation (Targeting Strategy)

A Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) proxy model was developed to segment customers, confirming the concentration of value.

Segment                 Contribution                     Strategic Focus (Opex Allocation)

1. High Value           Top 33% of total spenders        Retention, Upselling (Maximize Opex investment here)
2. Low Value            Bottom 33% of spenders           Cost Optimization (Minimize retention Opex here)

# Actionable Recommendations

These actions directly restore margin, save the quantified Opex cost, and guide strategic investment:

## 1. Control Promotional Opex: Cease Blanket Discounts
    Action: Eliminate all general, store-wide discounts. This action immediately saves the $1,427.77 lost to inefficient promotions.

    Strategy: Redirect discounting Opex to highly specific goals (e.g., reactivating known high-value customers, or clearing specific overstocked inventory).

## 2. Optimize Marketing Opex: Focus on Value
    Action: Reallocate at least 60% of the retention budget to target the High Value customer segment.

    Strategy: Focus resources on nurturing the core revenue base (especially the stable Age 40+ demographic) instead of general customer acquisition.

## 3. Strengthen Subscription Value
    Action: Pivot the value proposition away from monetary discounts.

    Strategy: Replace margin-eroding discounts with low-variable-cost benefits like guaranteed free and faster shipping, shifting the Opex focus from pricing to customer service/logistics, which strengthens loyalty without cutting profit.
